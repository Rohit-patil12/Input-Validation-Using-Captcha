            The World Bankâ€™s mission is to end extreme poverty and promote shared prosperity. It achieves this by providing financial and technical assistance to developing countries. The World Bank Group consists of five institutions: the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the International Development Association (IDA), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).
        </p>
        <p>
            These organizations work together to provide financial products, policy advice, and research to support countries in need. The World Bank is committed to projects that address critical challenges such as infrastructure development, education, and health services.
